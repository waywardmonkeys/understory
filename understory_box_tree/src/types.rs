use kurbo::{Affine, Rect, RoundedRect};

/// Identifier for a node in the tree.
///
/// This is a small, copyable handle that stays stable across updates but becomes
/// invalid when the underlying slot is reused.
/// It consists of a slot index and a generation counter.
///
/// ## Semantics
///
/// - On insert, a fresh slot is allocated with generation `1`.
/// - On remove, the slot is freed; any existing `NodeId` that pointed to that slot is now stale.
/// - On reuse of a freed slot, its generation is incremented, producing a new, distinct `NodeId`.
///
/// ### Newer
///
/// A `NodeId` is considered newer than another when it has a higher generation.
/// If generations are equal, the one with the higher slot index is considered newer.
/// This total order is used only for deterministic tie-breaks in
/// [hit testing](crate::Tree::hit_test_point).
///
/// ### Liveness
///
/// Use [`Tree::is_alive`](crate::Tree::is_alive) to check whether a `NodeId` still refers to a live node.
/// Stale `NodeId`s never alias a different live node because the generation must match.
///
/// ### Notes
///
/// - The generation increments on slot reuse and never decreases.
/// - `u32` is ample for practical lifetimes; behavior on generation overflow is unspecified.
