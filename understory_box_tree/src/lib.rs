//! Understory Box Tree: a Kurbo-native, spatially indexed box tree.
//!
//! Understory Box Tree is a reusable building block for UIs, canvas and vector editors, and CAD viewers.
//!
//! - Represents a hierarchy of regions with local transforms, clips, z-order, and flags.
//! - Provides hit testing and rectangle intersection queries over world-space AABBs.
//! - Supports batched updates with a [`Tree::commit`] step that yields coarse damage regions.
//!
//! It aims for a stable, minimal API and leaves room to evolve internals (for example a pluggable spatial index) without churn at call sites.
//!
//! ## Where this fits: three-tree model
//!
//! We’re standardizing on a simple separation of concerns for UI stacks.
//! - Widget tree: interaction/state.
//! - Box tree: geometry/spatial indexing (this crate).
//! - Render tree: display list (future crate).
//!
//! The box tree computes world-space AABBs from local bounds, transforms, and clips, and synchronizes them into a spatial index for fast hit testing and visibility queries.
//! This decouples scene structure from the spatial acceleration and makes debugging and incremental updates tractable.
//!
//! ## Not a layout engine
//!
//! This crate does not perform layout (measurement or arrangement) or apply layout policies such as flex, grid, or stack.
//! Upstream code is expected to compute positions and sizes using whatever layout system you choose and then update this tree with the resulting world-space boxes, transforms, optional clips, and z-order.
//! Think of this as a scene and spatial index, not a layout system.
//!
//! ## Integration with Understory Index
//!
//! This crate uses [`understory_index`] for spatial queries. You can choose the backend and scalar to
//! fit your workload (flat vector, R-tree or BVH). Float inputs are
//! assumed to be finite (no NaNs). AABBs are conservative for non-axis transforms and rounded clips.
//!
//! See [`understory_index::Index`], [`understory_index::RTreeF32`]/[`understory_index::RTreeF64`]/[`understory_index::RTreeI64`], and
//! [`understory_index::BvhF32`]/[`understory_index::BvhF64`]/[`understory_index::BvhI64`] for details.
//!
//! ## API overview
//!
//! - [`Tree`]: container managing nodes and the spatial index synchronization.
//! - [`LocalNode`]: per-node local data (bounds, transform, optional clip, z, flags).
//!   See [`LocalNode::flags`] for visibility/picking controls.
//! - [`NodeFlags`]: visibility and picking controls.
//! - [`InterestMask`]: optional per-node input interest hints used for pruning.
//! - [`NodeId`]: generational handle of a node.
//! - [`QueryFilter`]: restricts hit/intersect results (visible/pickable/interest).
//!   See [`NodeFlags::VISIBLE`], [`NodeFlags::PICKABLE`], and [`InterestMask`].
//!
//! Key operations:
//! - [`Tree::insert`](Tree::insert) → [`NodeId`]
//! - [`Tree::set_local_transform`](Tree::set_local_transform) / [`Tree::set_local_clip`](Tree::set_local_clip) / [`Tree::set_local_bounds`](Tree::set_local_bounds) / [`Tree::set_flags`](Tree::set_flags)
//! - [`Tree::set_interest`](Tree::set_interest) / [`Tree::interest`](Tree::interest)
//! - [`Tree::commit`](Tree::commit) → damage summary; updates world data and the spatial index.
//! - [`Tree::hit_test_point`](Tree::hit_test_point) and [`Tree::intersect_rect`](Tree::intersect_rect).
//! - [`Tree::z_index`](Tree::z_index) exposes the stacking order of a live [`NodeId`].
//!
//! ## Flags vs interest
//!
//! - [`NodeFlags`] control whether a node participates in rendering and hit-testing at all.
//!   - `VISIBLE` gates visibility queries and rendering.
//!   - `PICKABLE` gates hit-testing.
//! - [`InterestMask`] is a separate, optional hint about which kinds of input a node (or its subtree)
//!   cares about (pointer move, wheel, drag, key, etc.).
//!   - Flags are a correctness filter: if a node is not visible/pickable, it should not be hit.
//!   - Interest is a pruning hint: if `interest_required` is set on [`QueryFilter`], whole subtrees
//!     that advertise no matching interest can be skipped for that query.
//!   - When [`QueryFilter::interest_required`](crate::tree::QueryFilter::interest_required) is empty,
//!     behavior falls back to flags-only filtering.
//!
//! Typical usage for interest:
//! - Pointer move / hover and wheel events over large scenes where many nodes are non-interactive.
//! - Drag/gesture recognizers that only care about specific regions.
//! - As a cache of “who might handle this class of event” for higher-level routing layers.
//!
//! ## Damage and debugging notes
//!
//! - [`Tree::commit`] batches adds/updates/removals and produces coarse damage (added/removed AABBs and
//!   old/new pairs for moved nodes). This is enough to bound a paint traversal in most UIs.
//! - World AABBs are conservative under rotation/shear and rounded-rect clips are approximated by
//!   their axis-aligned bounds for acceleration; precise hit-filtering is applied where cheap.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! - `examples/basic_box_tree.rs`: builds a trivial tree, commits, and runs a couple of queries.
//! - `examples/visible_list.rs`: demonstrates using `intersect_rect` to compute a visible set,
//!   a building block for virtualization.
//!
//! This crate is `no_std` and uses `alloc`.
