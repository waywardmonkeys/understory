# Changelog

Understory Box Decoration has not had a published release yet.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added the initial `understory_box_decoration` crate with `no_std` resolved
  geometry primitives for CSS-style box decorations.
- Added `Edges`, `Corners`, `CornerRadii`, `CornerShape`, `Superellipse`,
  `BorderStyle`, `BoxContour`, and `BoxDecorationGeometry` for resolved
  physical edge widths, fitted elliptical corner radii, shaped corner contours,
  per-side border styles, derived border/padding/content geometry, and
  on-demand Kurbo path writing.
- Added `Side`, `BoxArea`, `BorderPaintGeometry`, `BorderSidePaintGeometry`,
  and border fill/stroke fragments for physical box-area selection and
  renderer-neutral border paint lowering.
- Added CSS specification baseline documentation for CSS Backgrounds and
  Borders Level 3 contours, plus initial CSS Borders and Box Decorations Level
  4 `corner-shape` / superellipse coverage and a roadmap for broader Level 4
  features.

### Changed

- Made the default feature set `libm` instead of `std` so the crate remains
  `no_std`-friendly by default while still forwarding Kurbo floating-point
  support.
