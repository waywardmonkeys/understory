# Changelog

Understory Tiling has not had a published release yet.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added the initial `understory_tiling` crate with `no_std` headless tiling,
  docking, layout frame, hit testing, operation, proposal, and interaction
  primitives.
- Added the persistent `TileTree` model with n-ary splits, tab groups, pane
  leaves, normalization, semantic operations, and flattened layout solving.
- Added basic drag/drop and resize proposal generation, validation and commit
  helpers, snapshot and repair shells, and pure-data regression tests.
- Added committed tab-group move operations so tab-bar drags can produce and
  apply real split-dock proposals.

### Changed

- Kept the initial public API focused on implemented MVP behavior by removing
  reserved replace, resize-delta, floating-surface, layout-constraint, and
  missing-pane repair placeholders.
- Resize previews now relayout with the caller-provided layout input instead of
  reconstructing geometry from the current frame.
